<b>Accessible</b>
<b>An easy-to-drink wine.</b> A good term to use in describing a well-balanced wine that doesn’t press the taster for anything complicated in the way of descriptors or enjoyment.


<b>Acetic</b>
<b>Wine aromas showing a pungent, sour or vinegary smell.</b> Wine does not have to be perfect to be enjoyable, but when a wine begins to smell like something better served on a salad than consumed as a beverage, it has tripped past the threshold for enjoyable drinking.


<b>Acidic</b>
<b>A wine with obvious high acidity.</b> Descriptors such as ‘tart’ or ‘shrill’ might also be appropriate. All wine has acidity. Wine with low acidity will taste flat (or flaccid) and will fail to serve satisfactorily in either its role as a digestive or “palate cleanser”, two very important roles served by wine. You choose your wine to drink based on the occasion and the food it will accompany. Wine served as simply a refreshment will serves that purpose best if it is relatively low in acidity but when you are eating ‘rich’ foods you are best served by a higher acid wine that will help clean your mouth and prepare it for giving you enjoyment from the next bite.


<b>Aftertaste</b>
<b>The lingering qualities remaining after swallowing wine.</b> When used in a positive way, it will serve to describe the wonderful qualities the wine can leave in the mouth after it is swallowed.


<b>Aging Of Wine</b>
<b>Some wines have the capacity to improve with age.</b> Most wines deliver enjoyable drinking when they are young and are intended to be consumed within a year or two after market release. The wine retains its balance and an enjoyable sense of fruitiness at this stage. In contrast, there are wines where the producer is offering wine capable of showing wonderful character and complexity far beyond what a young wine is capable of offering. In this case, it is up to the buyer to invest the time and effort to age the wine for anywhere from a few to many years. To age a wine with hope of its improving with age, it is important that it be initially well-balanced, stored out of the light and kept at a constant temperature. Wines stored at too cool a temperature will hardly age at all and wines stored at too high a temperature age too quickly and coarsen. The compromise temperature for wines intended to be cellar aged is roughly 54ºF (12ºC).


<b>Alcohol</b>
<b>All wine contains alcohol (ethanol/ethyl-alcohol) but some give the impression of being alcoholic or ‘hot’.</b> A naturally fermented wine may range in alcohol between roughly 8.5% to 17% and these levels are due to yeast converting fruit or berry sugars into alcohol. Wines can range above that level when distilled alcohol has been added, such as in the case of ‘port’ or ‘sherry’. Since alcohol serves as one of the preservatives that keep wine ‘stable’, low alcohol wines are best consumed when they are still quite young while high alcohol wines are capable of living well beyond a century. To taste good, of course, they need to be very well-balanced, or else they will taste quite ‘hot’, ‘burning’ or ‘alcoholic’ in the mouth without offering much of interest. Most wines intended to be served with meals will range between 10.5% and 14.5% in alcohol, and the alcohol level is almost always noted on the label (which is, at best, an approximation, since the label is printed before the wine is bottled).


<b>Aldehydic</b>
<b>Term used to describe an overly oxidized quality in wine.</b> When the wine is tasted the problem shows up as a ‘baked biscuits’ or ‘cooked’ tone and the word is usually used in a negative context describing quite different properties than the word ‘bouquet’.


<b>Appearance</b>
<b>Ideally a wine should be brilliant in your glass.</b> Whether effervescent, white, red or rosé, the color should be bright, clean and clear. The taste of a ‘cloudy’ appearing wine is not likely to be any more appealing in the mouth than it is to the eye. Wineries work hard to present consumers with wines that appear perfect to the eye, so any wine that does not live up to this standard was probably mishandled somewhere between the winery and when you open it.


<b>Appellation</b>
<b>Legally defined and regulated wine producing region.</b> The term applies to wine produced using grapes from a precisely defined and regulated grape-growing region and the term cannot be used for the sale or distribution of wines not meeting the standards established for the area. In the United States the legal term used is American Viticultural Area (AVA) and became part of National alcohol labeling laws in 1978. There are currently over 220 AVAs in the US, with more approved each year. Currently over 120 of the AVAs apply to winegrape growing districts in California and the regulations primarily relate to the source location of the grapes. In other regions of the world the legal regulations may control not only the use of these names but may specify details within the process used to produce the wine and require approval of a controlling board established to maintain standards set for the region. The system continues to evolve and the number of areas falling under such controls has increased over the past several decades. Regulations range from simply identifying the geographic source of the grapes but often extending to specific procedural controls regarding the grape varieties permitted and method of how the wine is made. In France there are well over 400 appellations controlled areas, over 300 in Italy and such limiting constraints are continuing to spread throughout the wine producing world — whether or not there is anything special about the region or its wines. Any or all of the restrictions can limit the chance for innovation and improvement of the wines as tastes change and winemaking techniques improve. We are following the precedence of Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson when, in writing their excellent collaboration, The World Atlas of Wine, decided not to detail land areas and the ways in which these regulations are applied. When necessary, we simplify our writing by referring to all such regulated areas as ‘Appellations’.  The first Appellations were created in Tuscany (Chianti) in 1716, Hungary (Tokaj) in 1730 and Portugal (Port) in 1756.


<b>Aroma</b>
<b>Aroma is a term for the fragrance of a wine.</b> Actually, both ‘aroma’ and ‘flavor’ are the same thing and detected by your sense of smell (or olfactory senses). Aromas are detected through your nose and flavors are detected when the wine releases its esters and other aromatic, volatile compounds while being warmed in your mouth. Except for warming the wine, your mouth is a limited sensing device that simply detects temperature, texture, acidity, bitterness, sweetness and alcoholic hotness - so the sense of smell is most critical in appreciating wine. Everyone’s sense of smell is unique in terms of both its range and sensitivity and what it recognizes is based on the data stored from past experience beginning in early childhood. When another taster, or a writer, tells you that a wine smells like ‘cinnamon’ or a particular flower, the words mean that it has jarred associations in that person’s memory from their past experiences and these words serve as their attempt to trigger similar experiences in your mind — but, it does not mean that it is the same aroma you will find in a fresh stick of cinnamon bark or a flower.


<b>Astringent</b>
Any wine can be astringent. But, astringency is most commonly noted in descriptions of red wines and is generally caused by the lingering presence of tannins from the skin and seeds of the grapes. Tannins will help preserve the wine for long and, hopefully, graceful aging — provided the wine is otherwise well-balanced and has other qualities that make it worth aging.


<b>Austere</b>
<b>Generally used to describe out-of-balance wines.</b> It is used to describe wines currently unrewarding to drink because of too high acidity or tannins and, in likelihood, the wine may prove unworthy of aging.


<b>Baked</b>
<b>Term applied to wine from sun-baked fruit.</b> When fruit is picked in the heat of the day it can take on a ‘cooked’ tone before it reaches the winery for processing. However, the term can also be used for wines mishandled by distributors or retailers who allow bottled wines to get overheated or ‘cooked’ before sale.


<b>Balance</b>
<b>Balance describes the mix of the components of a wine.</b> A ‘well-balanced’ wine is one where every element is harmonious. A wine can be described as out-of-balance when any of the elements are present in excess. For example, a wine might be too acidic, too alcoholic, too sweet or have too rough a texture. A ‘proper’ balance depends, of course, on the wine’s intended use. For example, a Sauvignon Blanc is expected to be on the acidic side while a tart Cabernet Sauvignon would be undesirable.


<b>Beverage Manager</b>
<b>Person employed by a restaurant or ship to order beverages.</b> Responsibilities include maintaining the appropriate supply of soft drinks, wine, beer, liquors, bar supplies and bottled water.


<b>Body</b>
<b>Sense of fullness and weight in the mouth.</b> The body of a wine can range from ‘thin’ to ‘heavy’.


<b>Botrytis</b>
<b>Abbreviation used to describe aromas found in certain dessert wines.</b> Botrytis cinerea is a unique form of ‘mold’ that can create the appealing and complex scents of some of the world’s most outstanding dessert wines. Instead of producing a dreaded moldy tone, this fungus reduces the water in a grape and ends up concentrating the sugar as well as producing a rich ‘honied’ aroma.


<b>Bouquet</b>
<b>A term applicable to wine aromas after bottle-aging.</b> As wines age in the bottle they take on complexities beyond the qualities that young wines derive from the grapes crushed to make the wine. The word Bouquet is reserved for this set of complex aromas, scents that can be quite appealing.


<b>Brett</b>
<b>Brettanomyces (or dekkera) is a yeast infection in wine.</b> The presence of these tones in a finished wine can generate controversy even among considerably experienced wine tasters. When ‘brett’ has caused an intense ‘barnyardy’, ‘horsey’ or ‘plastic bandaid’ tone in a finished wine it can be readily recognized as an obvious off-putting fault, beyond this there is disagreement. For example, brett can cause subtle aromatic tones that many wine tasters will regard as positive and intriguing complexities. These include some earthy, mushroomy, spicy and perfumy rose-like tones. Some wine tasters enjoy and expect wines with these complexities, while others, trained in precise ideals of ‘clean’ winemaking, might find any presence of ‘brett’ intolerable.


<b>Bright</b>
<b>A clean, clear impression.</b> A word perfectly appropriate to use for a wine’s visual, aromatic or entry impressions. Brilliant is another word that essentially carries the appearance rather than the entire meaning of Bright and implies ‘faultless’. Every winemaker aspires to their wine justifying this descriptor.


<b>Buttery</b>
<b>Aroma suggested in some wines, often associated with buttery scented/flavor bi-products of malolactic fermentation.</b> An impression sometime notable in barrel-fermented Chardonnays.


<b>Cassis</b>
<b>Another term for Black Currants fruit character.</b> Often wine reviewers will use the word Cassis to indicate one of the flavor/characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon. However, it is also used as a name for wine made from Black Currants.


<b>Cava</b>
<b>Spanish sparkling wine.</b> Sparking wine produced in Spain produced mainly by the Macabeo, Xarel-lo and Parellada winegrapes. In recent years restrictions against the inclusion of Pinot noir and Chardonnay have been relaxed.


<b>Cellaring (aka Binning, Bottle Aging)</b>
<b>Holding wine under temperature, light and vibration controlled conditions.</b> Cellaring is the process used to facilitate the controlled aging of select wines that are expected to have the potential to benefit from aging.


<b>Chemical</b>
<b>Noticeable presence of smells of Petroleum, Sulfur, Ethyl Acetate, Acetic acid, etc.</b>


<b>Champagne</b>
<b>Sparkling wine made in the Champagne district of France.</b> With few exceptions the wine name Champagne and the term Methode Champenoise have been exclusively reserved for wines produced in Champagne. About one of every twelve bottles of Sparkling Wines are produced in the district.


<b>Clean</b>
<b>Wine showing no obvious faults.</b> Winemakers aspire to make cleanly made wines and this is what you should expect. On the other hand, if a cleanly made wine has nothing else going for it — the wine may be dull and insipid and uninteresting to drink.


<b>Clone</b>
<b>Genetic copy of a grapevine deemed to yield fruit of appealing characteristics and asexually propagated to reproduce those qualities.</b> While in other categories in which the word is used, one might get a perfect copy but in viticulture slight genetic variations commonly occur among its many billions of cells. Thus, for every variety of grapevine, there can be many different clones, even though the difference between clones is considerably smaller than the difference between grapevine varieties.


<b>Closed</b>
<b>A wine that is not aromatic.</b> Wine is one of the few products that has a ‘life’ after packaging (most products, including beer, simply deteriorate and distilled products show little change at all). Wine goes through phases and sometimes a newly bottled wine that smelled ‘wonderful’ at the time it was bottled might show very little aromatic interest immediately after bottling until it is given time to regain some of those initial qualities.


<b>Cloying</b>
<b>Word usually used to describe a very sweet wine that lingers too long in the mouth.</b> Descriptor for wines with too much residual sugar and not enough acidity to clean the palate.


<b>Coarse</b>
<b>Wine with a rough feel on the palate.</b> Usually a wine high in tannins will seem very coarse on the palate. However, the mouthfeel will normally improve with aging.


<b>Color</b>
<b>Color is extracted from the skins of the grapes used to produce the wine.</b> White grape varieties can range from very pale to a light golden to an amber tone. A white wine can also be produced from red grapes so long as the pulp of the grape is not colored and the winemaking equipment that separates the skins from the juice of the grapes has not forced color from the skins.  The color of rosé and red wines can range greatly from a delicate orange tone to deep, dark, almost opaque red with purple hues. The art of winemaking is involved in determining the color of a specific wine. For example some of the best Pinot noirs ever produced had a distinct orange hue, reflecting Pinot noir’s weak color stability. However, winemakers have been very sensitive to their consumer’s preference for a strong red tone in wine and found that adding just enough color from intensely colored grapes yields a hue close to Cabernet Sauvignon, a color which finds a better response in the market.


<b>Cooked</b>
<b>Same as “Baked”</b> – but, possibly even more appropriate than the word ‘baked’ to use for wines overheated or otherwise mishandled after leaving the winery. White wines will even more rapidly show this deterioration than red wines and varietal differences turn reminiscent of the smell of overripe melons.


<b>Complex</b>
<b>A positive and admiring term used to indicate multifaceted positive qualities found in a wine.</b> Usually a wine described as complex will be well-made and well-balanced and beyond the reach of a brief description to describe its multi-layered aroma, bouquet, texture and flavor. It is the kind of wine over which reviewers wax poetical.


<b>Corked</b>
<b>A wine showing TCA (2,4,6-trichloroanisole) spoilage.</b> The ‘corky’, really unpleasant (wet dog, moldy paper, etc.), off-odor is usually a wine taint caused by a bad cork but it can come into the wine from other sources. To the agony of winemakers, the problem is hard to detect before bottling and can affect wines of any price range. Furthermore, while it is easy to identify the problem when it is intense, at low intensity it can simply mask the aromas you expect from the wine and can cause great disappointment. This problem has also encouraged the change to screwcap closures, rather than cork.


<b>Creamy</b>
<b>A soft, glyceriny mouthfeel without coarse edges.</b> Australian researchers and wine industry technical specialists have devoted serious study in recent years to ways in which the “mouthfeel” of a wine can be improved. Wine producers throughout the world are benefiting from their efforts.


<b>Crisp</b>
<b>A pleasing sense of acidity.</b> This is a prized quality in white wines intended to be refreshing or ‘clear the palate’ of other lingering flavors.


<b>Crush</b>
<b>Following the harvesting, or picking of the grapes, the fruit is delivered to the winery and the winemaking process is begun.</b> At this stage many wineries ‘sort’ the grapes by inspecting and eliminating any grapes that might cause an undesirable character in the finished wine and some may choose to chill the grapes and leave them a longer time on the skin to gain added flavor interest. But at some point they are placed into one of a variety of devices to be crushed into grape juice and begin the fermentation process. The annual time of the year in which this process takes place is referred to as ‘The Crush’.


<b>Crust</b>
<b>The sediment adhering to the inside of a wine bottle.</b> Often noted in aged bottles of red wine. The visual effect may be off-putting but the cause is a harmless deposit of potassium bitartrate and wine pigments.


<b>Depth</b>
<b>A complimentary term for wines of complexity.</b> Usually this term denotes layered complexity in the flavors and aromas as well as an interesting, long-finish.


<b>Dosage</b>
<b>Adding the dosage is the third step in the production of “fermented-in-the-bottle” Sparkling Wines.</b> This is the final chance a winery has in determining the sweetness level and the distinct proprietary finishing 'taste' for the product it is offering for sale. The winemaker adds a dollop of wine, sugar or any other additive the winery choses to include in order to fill the empty space created by the removal of solids produced during secondary fermentation. The wine is now ready to be cork finished. (See liqueur de tirage).


<b>Dried Up</b>
<b>A wine that has lost its freshness and fruitiness.</b> Wines that have simply nothing in reserve.


<b>Dry</b>
<b>A wine that does not show a perception of sweetness.</b> All wine has some residual sugar, but in ‘dry’ wines it is usually present below most wine drinkers level of perception. All wines can range between ‘dry’ and ‘sweet’ but few red wines are offered in a ‘sweet’ style. It is usually in white and rosé wines where unfermented grape sugar is deliberately left in the product and it is often done to cover an inherent bitterness from the grapes, to counter high acidity or to deliver an appealing ‘fruitiness’ to the taste impression. These wines can become more enjoyable to drink when finished with a perceptible touch of sweetness. On the cusp between ‘dry’ and ‘sweet’ is the artful point at which most tasters will describe a wine as having a pleasant ‘fruitiness’’, rather than ‘sweetness’. (Also see Dosage).


<b>Earthy</b>
<b>Reminiscence of mushrooms, truffles and forest scents.</b> These tones can originate from high levels of geosmin, that occur naturally in grapes, or may be a product of brett, a microbiological source or may be a product of oak and other woods used in the production of wine.


<b>Elegant</b>
<b>Wine possessing finesse and subtleties.</b> This is a judgement call in which a taster, or wine merchant, determines that a wine is impressively well-balanced and possesses agreeable nuances that persist in the finish. Of course, one person’s elegance may be another person’s word for ‘too subtle’.


<b>Enology</b>
<b>The science of winemaking.</b> All winemakers benefit from the scientific study of winemaking but not all winemakers are Enologists.


<b>Feminine</b>
<b>Wine possessing delicate aromas and silky textures.</b> Another judgement call. Like elegant, a feminine wine for one taster may be simply too subtle, or dull, for another.


<b>Fermentation</b>
<b>The conversion of sugar into alcohol.</b> In nature this is a process that begins with the interaction between the yeast that has settled on the skin of the fruit and the sugar developed during ripening. In commercial winemaking the Enologist tries to improve the process by introducing strains of yeast with predictable fermentation characteristics that will give favorable results to the finished product.


<b>Finish</b>
<b>The lingering qualities that remain after swallowing.</b> This term is often used interchangeable with the term ‘aftertaste’ or ‘length’. When it is used in a positive way, it will describe some wonderful impressions the wine leaves in the mouth after swallowing.


<b>Firm</b>
<b>Descriptive of the tactile perception of tannins in a red wine.</b> Or, if used in the description of a white wine, it might describe a high acid level.


<b>Flabby or Flaccid</b>
<b>Wine lacking in acidity.</b> The term is usually used to describe the impression in the mouth of a wine lacking ‘structure’.


<b>Flat</b>
<b>A Sparkling Wine that has lost its effervescence.</b> Simply resealing the bottle after opening a Champagne or Sparkling Wine and keeping it chilled can often hold onto the effervescence for up to a week. Special closures are designed and available for this special type of bottle.

<b>Flavor</b>
<b>When wine is warmed in the mouth, esters are released and then arrive in your ‘sense of smell’ to be interpreted and defined.</b> The warming may change the impression sent to your brain.


<b>Flawed</b>
<b>A wine may be considered ‘flawed’ when any ‘nuance’ within its composition clearly reaches beyond being describable as ‘an interesting complexity’.</b> It is essentially a word of art and leads to disagreement between tasters. For example, an Enologist trained to produce ‘clean’ wines without a trace of ‘brett’ may find any perceptible trace of Brettanomyces wholly unacceptable, another trained in an environment where this yeast infection is frequently encountered will actually expect the infection to be present. Reduced aromas, such as burnt match or rotten egg can also flaw an otherwise sound wine.


<b>French Hybrids</b>
<b>The grape varieties known by this name emerged from a period when French hybridizers made a heroic effort to produce appealing new grape varieties that could survive the attack of the root eating Phylloxera pest that was devastating prime vineyards throughout the world.</b> Appealing varieties were achieved but the solution that proved faster and most practical was to bud or graft desired existing wine grape varieties onto American root stock, vines whose health and vigor were relatively impervious to the root louse. A number of attractive hybrid varieties can still be found producing wines in Northern American vineyards and around the world, although France has made a determined effort to return their vineyards to traditionally popular varieties for which they had established a market.


<b>Fruity</b>
<b>Fruit-like impressions in a wine.</b> This is a term that needs to be placed in a context in order to be meaningful. For example, a wine may seem ‘fruity’ because it has a level of sweetness just on the cusp of perception or ‘fruity’ may refer to triggering reminiscent perceptions of a specific kind of ripe fruit or berry. For example, a ‘botrytis’ touched sweet dessert wine might recall sweet smelling dried apricots while, by contrast, some Sauvignon Blancs recall impressions of fresh lichee nuts and a Zinfandel may recall the appealing scents of raspberries.


<b>Grapey</b>
<b>Wines reminiscent of Muscat or Concord grapes.</b> The character usually found in ‘grape juice’ or grape flavored candy.


<b>Grassy</b>
<b>Tones that can often be found as a varietal character in wines such as Sauvignon Blanc.</b> In addition to being a varietal characteristic, grassiness, herbaceous and ‘cat piss’ tones can be prevalent to a fault in wines made from grapes that lacked adequate exposure to sunlight prior to being harvested.


<b>Hard</b>
<b>A sometimes descriptive term for an overly tannic wine.</b> Again, this may be a problem resolved after more time in the bottle, provided the rest of the components are in balance and there is ample fruit to age the wine sufficiently.


<b>Harsh</b>
<b>Term used to describe coarse or tannic wines.</b> This is a negative quality that longer aging in the bottle can often take care of, or, maybe not.


Harvest
<b>A term used to mark the time of year in which the fruit is picked.</b> The Harvest may extend for as much as a four month period or more.


<b>Herbaceous</b>
<b>Scents reminiscent of herbs or vegetal tones.</b> Some grape varieties are more pronounced with this character than others (for example, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon) but an excessive vegetal tone can emerge when grapevines are grown with too heavy a canopy of leaves shading its fruit. Too strong an herbaceous or vegetal character can be undesirable for any wine.


<b>Hot</b>
<b>Wines that have perception of excessive alcohol.</b> Alcohol does not soften or go away over time and may become unredeemably unpleasant as other components fade.


<b>Legs</b>
<b>Tracks left on the inside of a glass after swirling the wine.</b> Wines with larger, more abundant, legs will generally have a rounder and fuller texture on the palate.


<b>Length</b>
<b>’Length’ and the term ‘Aftertaste’ are the words used to describe the period of time that desirable aromas and flavors linger in the mouth after a wine is swallowed.</b>


<b>Liqueur de tirage</b>
<b>Mix of sugar and yeast used to start secondary fermentation in Sparkling Wine.</b> Producing an appealing base wine is the first step in establishing the character and distinctive qualities of a "fermented-in-the-bottle" Sparkling Wine. Following the aging of this still wine, the critical second step is to add a blend of sugar, yeast and other ingredients that will set off a secondary fermentation within the bottle and, to a large degree determine the unique proprietary character of product being offered for sale. (See dosage).


<b>Luscious</b>
<b>A mouthcoating impression that lingers on the palate.</b> Admiring term usually reserved for sweet dessert wines.


<b>Malolactic Fermentations</b>
<b>This is a secondary bacterial fermentation that converts Malic acid to the softer Lactic acid.</b> Generally the unpleasant acidic, overly tart, sensations in your mouth are caused by an elevated acidity. There are two principal forms of organic acids found in wine, Tartaric and Malic acid, and Malic can either be a desirable presence or cause too much of an assertive sensation in the mouth. By using a lactic acid bacterial strain it is possible to convert the stronger malic acid into the less assertive lactic acid. The major effect is to reduce a harsh perception of acidity. While this winemaking procedure used to be a somewhat chancy procedure in winemaking, the availability of pure strains of the bacteria has made it a process used in most dry red table wine production. In white wines it is rarely used for it can neutralize some of the desired fruity aromas and flavors. Barrel fermented Chardonnay is the exception, where the action of Malolactic fermentation heightens the complexity of the resulting wine.


<b>Minerality</b>
<b>Somewhat the opposite of fruity or lush.</b> The imagined impressions of smooth crushed granite on the palate. Often it is a style found in various dry white wines grown in cool climates but it can also be produced when winemakers are trying to harvest fruit at the moment it tastes ripe and characterful, yet are trying to avoid a rise in grape sugar level that would produce an undesirably high alcohol level.


<b>Mouthfeel</b>
<b>The texture of a wine across the palate.</b> Mouthfeel can be used to describe any or all of the tactile sensations experienced within your mouth while tasting wine. These include alcohol, acidity, residual sugar and tannin


<b>MW</b>
<b>A Master of Wine.</b> A person who has successfully passed the arduous and in depth examination established by the Institute of Masters of Wine. The Institute maintains administrative offices in London and functions worldwide. The first MW title was awarded in 1953. A non-profit Institute, it offers an education program and holds events.


<b>New World Wines</b>
<b>Broadly this term is used to describe wines produced from fruit grown anywhere other than in Central Europe.</b> More specifically, the term describes wines that are competitive in International trading and are produced from the prime popular varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, etc.). These wines are generally identified by their varietal names, rather than bearing only a regional or appellation identity, but may be identified by a proprietary name.


<b>Nose</b>
<b>Term for the aromas and bouquet of a wine.</b> Frequently used term meaning the aromatic impressions of a wine.


<b>Oaky</b>
<b>The scent of oak in wine.</b>  As wines are fermented and/or aged in barrels unique scents and flavors are imparted. These specifically reflect the forest origin of the oak. When California winemakers started ordering French barrels in the ‘sixties and ’seventies they were quite surprised in discovering the degree to which the character of oak barrels affected the aroma and taste of their finished wines — for the French winemakers had long talked about ‘Terroir’ as the principal cause of difference, not the impact that oak had on the flavor in their wines. This was to some degree because the French winemakers were looking for consistency in the character of their wines and the California winemakers were still experimenting and searching for the most appealing tones they could bring to their new wines. Thus, French winery barrel sources seldom varied from year to year and the Californians were open to exploration. During this process, the distinctive impressions of various kinds of oak aromas and flavors became widely recognized by American and other New World winemakers.  Suddenly the source of the elusive and distinctive qualities some French wines possessed became apparent to winemakers throughout the world and further spurred the market for French oak barrels. This led to more artful winemaking but sometimes it also led to the excessive presence of oak, particularly in Chardonnay, causing some consumers to reject ‘oaky’ wines that show more than a subtle presence of wood tones. Oak is not the only wood used in the production of wine but is the predominant wood.


<b>Oxidized</b>
<b>A wine that has deteriorated due to too much exposure to air.</b> While Sherry and Madeira are intended to have a “nutty” oxidized character, this is considered a fault for wines intended to be served as a table wine.


<b>Palate</b>
<b>The impressions of a wine within your mouth.</b> Technically, your “palate” is the roof of your mouth but it is loosely used in wine jargon as a synonym for ‘mouthfeel’.


<b>Peak</b>
<b>Term usually used with modifiers.</b> For example, a wine going downhill in the judgement of a critic would be “past its peak”, a wine ready to drink might be “at its peak” or “coming to its peak”. Essentially this is a judgement call regarding the optimal time to drink a particular wine. It is an important skill for anyone to develop who intends to develop and maintain a personal or professional wine cellar.


<b>Peppery</b>
<b>A term suggesting presence of a black pepper impression.</b> Some wine grapes carry qualities that people find reminiscent of black pepper.


<b>Polished</b>
<b>Smooth and refined impressions.</b> A complementary term describing wines finished with no rough or coarse edges.


<b>Prickly (aka Pétillance, Frizzante)</b>
<b>Wine with a slight carbonic edge.</b> Usually a sensation found in a very youthful wine intended to be consumed while still young or deliberately intended to carry a slight effervescence. Some rosé wines and young white Vinho Verdes from Northern Portugal often carry this impression at the prime of their appeal. The term is also applicable in a negative way to wines carrying a slight effervescence because they were not properly finished before bottling and unintentionally have re-fermented in the bottle.


<b>Prosecco</b>
<b>Prosecco is a winegrape mainly found in its popular form as an Italian Sparkling Wine.</b>


<b>Pruney or Raisiny</b>
<b>Wine scents reminiscent of dried fruit.</b> This character comes from the inclusion of semi-dried and overripe grapes within clusters included in the crush.


<b>Reduced</b>
<b>A reductive, or ‘sulfidy’ disagreeable tone in the aromas.</b> An off-odor that can range from a stagnant ‘swampy’ smell to tones reminiscent of ‘burnt match’, ‘rotten egg’ or ‘skunky’.


<b>Round</b>
<b>A word used in reference to the mouthfeel of a wine.</b> A round mouthfeel is likely to offer a supple impression on the palate.


<b>Sharp</b>
<b>An overly acidic impression in the mouth.</b>


<b>Sherry</b>A Sherry-like or sherrified tone indicates oxidization.</b> A tone intentionally found in Sherries, Madeiras and various aperitif wines but also appears in white wines that have passed their prime.


<b>Short</b>
<b>Descriptive term for wine that almost disappears on entry.</b> A wine that makes an ultra-brief appearance on your palate and leaves you with no desire for another sip.


<b>Smoky</b>
<b>Word needing to be used with further descriptors.</b> This word can describe anything from the pleasant nuances acquired from wines aged in ‘toasted’ wine barrels or the unpleasant tones of wine afflicted with the ash residual left on the grapes from the smoke of a brush or forest fire.


<b>Sommelier</b>
<b>Person employed by a restaurant to organize and maintain the restaurant’s wine inventory.</b> The Sommelier performs service to patrons as the most knowledgable person as to the character of each wine in the inventory and can assist diners to find an appropriate wine to best serve with the food they are ordering.


<b>Sparkling Wine</b>
<b>An effervescent style of wine produced in practically every wine producing area of the World.</b> Many claim that of all of the effervescent wine produced in the world, the products of France’s Champagne district produce the most impressive wines of this type and through International agreements wines labeled Champagne must be produced within its defined district. This helped clarify the market and resolved some fraud cases.


<b>Spicy</b>
<b>A reminiscense of the appealing scents of spice.</b> A term of art usually used in context with other terms (clove, cinnamon, coriander, etc.) and in a complementary way.


<b>Spumante</b>
<b>Name for Italian sparkling wines.</b> ‘Asti’ sparkling wine is produced from Moscato Bianco winegrapes, which is also the main grape used in the large production of bubbly’ from the provinces of Cuneo and Alessandria. A wide array of other grapes are used to produce sparkling wines throughout Italy and Franciacorta and Trentino feature sparklers produced using the dominant Champagne varieties Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Over thirty appellations (DOCs) allow production of sparkling wines. Marketing of sparkling wine produced from the Prosecco winegrape is increasingly offered under the name of the grape.


<b>Structure</b>
<b>A term related to balance and texture.</b> Another term of art suggesting the impression on the palate by a wine. The term can be used focusing on a wine’s acidity or tannins and is commonly modified in context with other terms to convey its meaning.


<b>Supple</b>
<b>A term describing the ‘mouthfeel’ of a wine.</b> Supple can convey the impression a wine makes while passing through one’s mouth. When a wine is described in this way it implies good balance without abrasive, harsh or sharp qualities on the palate. The wine whispers rather than shouts its virtues.


<b>Tannic</b>
<b>Term usually used reflecting a noticeably high astringency level in the texture.</b> Red wines will always show a presence of tannins, which come from the skins and seeds of winegrapes. Tannins are one of the elements that help preserve a wine and give a red wine a chance to improve with aging. An overly tannic wine will be rough and unenjoyable without further aging.


<b>Tart</b>
<b>Notable acidity.</b> Many white wines can be described as ‘tart’ and are perfectly enjoyable when served with the right foods. But, an excessively tart wine has the same problem that any fruit or beverage can have and will simply reflect a poor balance between the sugar that is present and the acidity.


<b>Terroir</b>
<b>A very important cause of difference in the distinct and final character in wine, from a French perspective.</b> Since the French have a very competitive wine market, wherever a line is drawn to define which vines are within or outside of an appellation can make a huge difference in the price a vineyard owner may gain year-after-year for the winegrapes harvested from vines within a defined area versus those produced from vines outside of the line. Factors involved in setting these lines include soil type, local topography, microclimate and mesoclimate.


<b>Texture</b>
<b>This term describes the tactile feel of a wine on the palate.</b> This tactile sensation may range between somewhat rough or coarse sensations to those that are best described as supple or creamy, or even silken, and make a smooth passage across the palate.


<b>Thin</b>
<b>A wine that doesn’t seem to have a “there there”.</b> A thin wine will lack the impression of weight and substance.


<b>Toasty</b>
<b>A term used to describe an apparent impression of oak or charred wood scents in a finished wine.</b> In the production of barrels the staves are bent by using fire and variations in the charred effect can affect the finished aromas and flavors of wine. The toasty tones from barrel making also affects the finished character of the wine and winemakers have learned to use this knowledge to their advantage or to sometimes excess.


<b>Touring</b>
<b>Visiting wineries.</b> Many wineries get into the ‘hospitality’ business in order to promote their wines and to sell their products. These facilities welcome visitors and some give tours of their facilities hoping to favorably impress their guests with their winemaking prowess and to gain loyal consumers for their brands. Most of the wineries that welcome visitors will offer an opportunity to taste some of the wines (either at a fee or not) currently available for sale and a more limited number might have a restaurant or picnic facility on premises. It is wise not to assume access to a facility without checking their policies and the hours in which staff is available to welcome guests.


<b>Varietal</b>
<b>Fruit characteristics unique to a particular kind of grape.</b> Each grape variety has its own distinctive set of aromas and flavors. A “varietal” wine with the name of the grape on the label will be made either entirely or, for the most part, from that grape variety. You should expect the wine to reflect the unique set of aromatic and flavor characteristics natural to that grape.


<b>Vegetal</b>
<b>Vegetative tones in the aromas of a wine.</b> Usually an excessive reminiscence of the tones found in vegetables (asparagus, bell pepper, lima beans, etc.) can be a problem and it is not modified by the length of time a wine spends in its bottle. (see Herbaceous)


<b>Vintage</b>
<b>Literally, vintage means the specific year in which the grapes were grown and crushed for the winemaking process.</b> Due to the favorable or unfavorable climate conditions leading into any year’s crush, the resulting wines will vary in their composition and character and this can lead to great differences in value and price from one vintage to another.


<b>Viticulture</b>
<b>The science and practice of grape growing.</b> The critical first step in fine winemaking is to start with excellent fruit.


<b>Voluptuous</b>
<b>Lush, mouth-filling sensations.</b> Another useful word of art that can describe the sensation you will experience while the wine is on your palate.


<b>Wine Faults</b>
<b>Any of the variety of problems that can arise during winemaking.</b> Specific descriptions of these defects and their cause can be found in various wine textbooks as well as on such Internet sources as Wikipedia.


<b>Wine Steward</b>
<b>The person on a ship who organizes and maintains the ship’s wine inventory.</b> The Wine Steward is the most knowledgable person as to the character of each wine in the inventory and can assist diners to find the wines to best accompany the foods they are ordering.
