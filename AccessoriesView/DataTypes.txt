AGLIANICO
Calabria and south Italy red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Red grape variety producing wines with soft tannins, good depth of color, ripe plum tones and suggestions of chocolate. </b> Arguably the source of the best red wines of Calabria and other regions of southern Italy. The Taurasi region reputedly delivers the best expression of this grape.


y
ALBARIÑO    
Exceptional white wine grape.
Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. 
(aka Alvarinho in Portugal): <b>Generally recognized as Spain and Portugal’s best producer of white wine, this grape delivers well balanced wines that offer distinctive aromas, ranging from green apple to peach, while delivering a crisp, fruity impression in the mouth.</b> It can pair exceptionally well as a complementary white wine when served with shellfish. The grape is at home in the Rías Baixas appellation, a wine growing region located in the cool Atlantic-influenced, westerly side of the Galicia region of Spain. It is also at home in similar environmental conditions across the border in Portugal and is finding a home in many New World wine producing areas.


r
ALICANTE BOUSCHET
Smokey, black but useful.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka: Alicante and as Garnacha Tintorera): <b>This red grape produces a deeply colored, somewhat blunt wine although not very characterful wine. </b> The grape is red-fleshed and its wines are particularly valued for their ability to add color to and enhance the marketability of other varieties. Well-traveled and generous bearing, it is a cross of Petit Bouschet and Grenache and is found in many warm and arid regions. It continues to play an important role in the Languedoc-Roussillon Region of France and can be found in Provence, Israel, Corsica, Calabria and many other wine regions. While dismissed for having no special varietal interest, it is perhaps a perfect wine to match with chunks of hearty barbecued meats. 


y
ALIGOTÉ   
Capable of producing fine whites.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, Pastas, etc.
<b>White grape often found as the principal base for a variety of somewhat tart, everyday white wines.</b> Popular in eastern Europe, it is also found as the ‘other’ white winegrape in the region of Bourgogne (Burgundy). It is the world's eleventh most planted grape vine and proven in some sites to have the potential for yielding fine white wines and attactive sparkling wines. In the French village of Bouzeron, it has gained an honored reputation and sold as Bourgogne Aligoté.


2ry
Aloxe-Corton
Some of world's best Pinot noirs.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Pinot noirs from the Grand Cru Corton site in the Côte d’Beaune mainly reach market under the name Aloxe-Corton and are some of the Côte d’Or's most famed red wines and the price of the wines reflect this fame.</b> Generally the reputation of the red Grand Cru wines of Aloxe-Corton are to be dense and closed-in in their youth. However, the designated Grand Cru area includes some 28 separate vineyards and each producer claims their wine has its own special distinction (for example, Bressandes is known as relatively supple, Renardes has a gamey character, Perrières is known for finesse, and Clos du Roi offers optimum balance). The Corton site is unique as the only Grand Cru red wine site located within the Côte de Beaune. The others are located on the Côte de Nuits -- and yet, this outstanding site produces some of Burgundy's best red wines, as well. These Pinot noir vineyards are grown immediately below the Grand Cru Corton-Charlemagne Chardonnay vineyards. There are also 14 Premier Crus in the vicinity, as well as many wines simply offered as Côte de Beaune-Villages but none of these guarantee qualities bearing close resemblance to the wines that have fame for the Grand Cru red Corton and Grand Cru white Corton-Charlemagne vineyards.


y
ALVARINHO  
Portuguese for Albariño.
Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
(aka: Albariño). <b>The wine is firmly balanced and serves well with a variety of dishes best served with white wine.</b> Alvarinho is one of the first Portuguese white grape varieties to appear as a varietal wine. Although not as widely planted or internationally distributed as its Spanish counterpart, the wine is quite appealing but usually offered in a style a little less fruit forward than its Spanish cousin when grown in the Rias Baixas appellation. It is steadily gaining in popular recognition.



2dr
Amarone
Intense color & richness.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />(Dessert) Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit. 
<b>Made of partially dried grapes crushed to produce a red wine intense in color, flavor, fine balance and with a pleasing richness.</b> This winemaking process starts with superior quality bunches of fruit and then placed into drying rooms which are controlled for temperature and humidity. The principal varieties of grape used for this process are the Corvina and Corvinone, with a relatively small amount of the Rondinella grape included. Production of the “Amarone Classico” version of this wine is only authorized in the zone that produces Valpolicella, although non-Classico Amarone can be produced in a wider but also defined regulated region. Amerone has been experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Noteworthy producers include Allegrini, Bussola, Ca' La Bionda, Dal Forno and Quintarelli.


y
ARINTO 
Grape source for Vinho Verde.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
(aka Ribatejo, Pedern and Terras do Sado): <b>White grape used as one of the principal ingredients in the production of Bucelas and Vinho Verde wines. </b> The grape provides a citrusy quality to its wines its palate cleansing crisp acidity makes it attractive as a refreshing food wine.


y
ARNEIS
White with wild flowers aromas.
Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. <br />(Aperitif) Sipping Or Easy-Drinking Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
(aka the ‘White Wine of Piemonte’). <b>The Arneis grape produces a softly structured white wine capable of offering delightful aromas of wild flowers and dried herbs. </b> It is an excellent choice as a chilled aperitif. As one of the few white grape varieties in the Piemonte region of Italy, it has been used to improve access to hard and inaccessible Barolos when co-fermented together with Nebbiolo grapes in small amounts. It has also gained well-deserved recognition in its own right as an attractive light- to medium-bodied wine of distinctive character. In Piemonte noteworthy producers include Malvira, Deltetto, Cascina Chicco and Bruno Giacosa. It is also emerging globally as an attractive winemaking grape through producers in California. Australia and other parts of Italy.


y
ASSYRTICO
White wine produced in Greece.
Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
(aka Assyrtiko) <b>Usually showing a somewhat minerally character, the wine from this white grape is usually found enriched by being blended with Malagousia, Sauvignon Blanc and/or Semillon.</b> Assyrtico wines are noted for good mouth cleansing acidity. The grape is grown mainly in Greece.


y
BACCHUS
Well structured wines.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b>German grape variety developed from a SilvanerXRiesling crossing and Müller-Thurgau and appears to be gaining interest among British wine producers.</b> It yields reliable white wine in Britain's climate and delivers wines of good structure. 


r
BACO NOIR
Medium-bodied, fruity red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Wine made from this red skinned French hybrid tends to be relatively light bodied and fruity with a somewhat herbaceous scent.</b> Some producers have also managed to offer it in a fuller, fairly mellow style. Baco blanc and Baco noir were once widely planted but only Baco Noir is still readily available, mainly in the northeastern part of the United States and in Canada.

Bandol 
Best expression of Mourvèdre.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Aperitif) Sipping Or Easy-Drinking Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
<b>Through its lush and flavorful red wines, Bandol can be called the most serious wine produced in Provence, although the region is undergoing a serious upgrading in its vineyards, wine production and regulations</b>. This wine manages to deliver the highest expressions obtainable from the Mourvèdre grape and Bandol regulations require the wines to spend 18 months in cask. In addition, charming rosés using blends of Grenache and Cinsault are offered from Bandol. 


2dr
Banyuls
Complex, regional Grenache blends.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />(Dessert) Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit.
<b>Wines of the Banyuls appellations of France, and notably the Grand Banyuls, make a match for the most savory of dishes and can show Grenache in its richest rendition.</b> Reminiscent of Port when fermentation is halted with the addition of alcohol, the wine is finished with varying levels of residual sugar. These wines are complex, long-aging and relatively high in alcohol (must be at least 15%). A Banyuls Grand Cru is also required to be aged in oak for a minimum of 30 months and contain at least 75% Grenache. Banyuls is a seaside area in the Roussillon region at the eastern end of the Pyrenées Mountains, one of the sunniest parts of France.  


r
Barbaresco    
Outstanding Nebbiolo-based wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Produced, like Barolo, from the Nebbiolo grape, the wines have proven pleasing for their relative (only to Barolo) softness, elegance, perfumed aromas and earlier accessibility.</b> Traditionally regarded as the lesser of the two major wines of the Piemonte region of Italy, the wine has gained greatly in prestige and popularity in recent years and offers its own distinctive charm and finesse. Leading producer: Angelo Gaja. 


r   
BARBERA
Bright and lively red wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>This widely-traveled grape is usually enjoyed as a bright and lively light- to medium-bodied, fruity red wine but can also command high regard and ships well when produced as a somewhat more robust, deeply colored red wine.</b> In both forms its juice delivers a well-balanced, enjoyable food friendly wine that has an edge towards tartness. Its principal role among Italian reds is to be consumed with food when it is young and it is an important varietal in Italy. The most respected come from the Piemonte district and Lombardia, but Barberas have also enjoyed success when produced in appropriate California vineyard sites.


r
Barolo
Nebbiolo-based, powerful wines.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>One of the most prestigious wines of Italy, it is a powerful and dramatic dry red wine produced from Nebbiolo grapes.</b> While seeming almost inaccessible as a young wine, it still captures attention by revealing intriguing scents of dried rose petals and licorice along with plum-like tones in its aromas and lingering aftertaste. Produced in a glacier-sculptured part of the Piemonte region, it is regarded by its fans as one of the world’s Great Wines. The Barolos that well justify that claim, come from bottles that have been properly and patiently cellar aged and with wine produced from a favorable vintage. Its producers take pride in both its longevity and depth. Responding to current market trends, there is a movement within the region toward offering Barolos that are more accessible when young and reveal fruit-forward aromas and flavors. To know what to expect in purchasing bottles of either Barolo or Barbaresco in restaurants and retail stores, it is wise to seek experienced and knowledgable guidance. (For the white wine of Piemonte see ARNEIS).


Dg
Barsac
Bordeaux white dessert wine.
Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit, Also With Foie Gras.
<b>Important sweet, white dessert wine of Bordeaux which can be produced of either Semillon or Sauvignon Blanc or a combination of both.</b> Due to overlapping geographic boundaries, all wines produced in the Barsac appellation can also be identified as Sauternes. Lead producers include Climens, Coutet and Doisy-Daëne.


r
BASTARDO
Usually less-than-interesting red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka Trousseau, Merenzao): <b>Name popularly attached to a number of red winegrapes but is grown mainly in Portugal and in the Jura region of France, on the Swiss border </b>). It shows up as part of some producer’s Port blends, and a handful of Jura producers turn it into a deeply flavored wine. 


r
Beaujolais
Gamay-based, fruity red wines.
Vegetable Stews, Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc. <br />(SpicyFoods) Agreeable Matches For Highly Spiced Or Hotly Seasoned Foods.
<b>While Beaujolais was always a popular source for Gamay-based, fruity, light red wines, the area restated its image in a big way starting in the ‘nineteen fifties, with its shortly-after-stability-is-achieved Beaujolais Nouveau (or Prieurs) releases.</b> While these brash, barely finished versions of its popular wines are straightforward and fruity quaffs not meant to be aged, the winemakers are laughing all the way to the bank as over 100 countries now eagerly await the third Thursday of November for the international release of these wines. A full third of the region’s winegrape harvest goes into their production. However, the later releases are more refined and polished and can dependably deliver the delightful fruity appeal of the Gamay grape in a version that will hold up well and deliver an enjoyable wine for a half dozen or so years after release. Located in the southern part of Bourgogne (but administered under the joint administration of two other regions, the Beaujolais region has a temperate climate and varied terrain from its northernmost reaches down to the rolling hills of the South, as well as many smaller appellations. There are neither Grand Cru nor Premier Cru vineyards in this region. Gamay is the prime winegrape and is a variety of grape the Dukes of Burgundy tried to eliminate from Bourgogne but it endured and thrives in this warmer part of eastern France. The wine is also offered by some producers as a fairly concentrated red table wine capable of holding appeal as it matures.


r
Beaune
Red wines of considerable grip.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>The Pinot noire are perfumed with hints of violets, black cherry and black current tones, and capable of picking up truffle scents as they age.</b> While Beaune has no Grand Cru, it has 42 Premier Crus and is regarded as the wine capital of Bourgogne.


r
Bierzo
Appealing Mencia-based reds.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The Region’s Mencia red winegrape is catapulting this Northwest Spanish region into prominence through delivering fruity red wines with appealing mouthfeel, good body and superb balance and that carry subtle floral scents.</b> Bierzo is a small appellation in northwest Spain where its energetic winemakers are introducing to the world another of Spain's more than the 325 grape varieties. The particular appeal here is that the wines complement a great range of savory foods. 


F
Blanc de Blancs   
Sparkling Wine from white grapes.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres.
<b>Neither a grape nor a region, this label on a Sparkling Wine indicates the wine is produced entirely from white grapes.</b> These will typically be the lightest, most delicate of all sparkling wines.


F
Blanc de Noirs
Sparkling Wine from red grapes.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. (Actually, Blanc de Noir and most sparkling wines can be served with any range of foods and acts as a superior digestive.)
<b>Color may actually vary from clear, to onion-skin, to salmon-colored, to a pink rosé tone, to light red.</b> As red grapes are prominent in their production, Blanc de Noir bottlings can be a bit richer and fuller in character than Blanc de Blancs and it is simply a question of what one seeks in their Sparkling wine.


r
BLAUFRANKISCH
Spicy, fruity red wine grape.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.<br /> Light meats, pastas, casseroles, etc.
(aka Lemberger in both Germany and North America): <b>The Blaufrankisch grape can be expected to deliver spicy, medium-bodied, fruity wines with moderate tannins.</b> The Blaufrankisch grape produces some of the better red wines of Central Europe and has been especially successful for Austria's producers. It has garnered increased interest of late as well as respect in the International wine marketplace.


r
BOBAL
Produces fruity Valencia reds.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A deeply colored red Spanish wine grape variety from which producers such as Mustiguillo manage to attain a wine with velvety appeal.</b> However, it is mainly used in bulk wine production for it retains its acidity well and presents a good structure. 


r
BONARDA
Light, fruity Argentina red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>This second-most-planted Argentine red wine grape produces an agreeable wine with a more subtle character than Malbec</b>. The Argentine named 'Bonarda' wine grape may actually be the now-rare Charbono grape. Two other red wines are marketed by the same name in Italy, but of different variety grapes.


2ry
Bordeaux     
Large region offering prized wines
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />(WhiteWine) Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b> A large appellation along France’s Atlantic Coast, it contains a series of defined smaller appellations producing some of the most collected and prized blegnded red wines of the world. </b> However, most Bordeaux grapes are grown by small property holders and produced by cooperative wineries and fall shy of the appellation’s grand regard. Six grape varieties are permitted in the blend of a red wine labeled Bordeaux: Merlot (by far the most planted vine in the region), Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenère (once thought lost but in recent years rediscovered as an important red wine variety in Chile and misidentified there as Merlot). With notable exceptions, White Bordeaux is generally less highly regarded than red Bordeaux, in spite of some remarkable dry Sauvignon Blancs and appealing Semillons. The white wines are permitted to include Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, Colombard and Merlot Blanc. Remarkably, Bordeaux is also the home of some of the most highly regarded dessert wines in the world, which is where Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon gain in recognition. The sweet dessert wines are produced under the appellation names Sauterne and Barsac.


2ry
Bourgogne
French region known as Burgundy
The English have a long tradition of renaming cities and districts in other countries by an English name. So, the region in France known as Bourgogne is known in English as ‘Burgundy’. 


r
Bourgueil
Cabernet Franc-based Loire red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A fragrant and often charming Cabernet Franc based wine is made by Bourqueil producers on the North bank of the Loire river.</b> Some tasters find a hint of raspberries in the wine. Since 2000, regulations permit as much as 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.


r
BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO
Tuscan full, rich, red wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>The Brunello di Montalcino region of Tuscany delivers some of the fullest, richest red wines produced from the Sangiovese grape and is one of the most highly esteemed red wines of Italy.</b> The wines are made from a Sangiovese Grosso clone locally known as Brunello and grown in the most arid and the warmest appellation within Tuscany. Most are made entirely from the Brunello grape, although some producers add complexity to their particular vineyard's Brunello through additions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. To bear this label the wine is required to remain in casks for 42 months.  There is also a Rosso di Montalcino version, which can be released within a year. Leading producers include Altesino, Argiano, Banfi, Casse, Costanti, Eredi Fuligni, Fossacolle, Lisini, Pieve di Santa Restituta and Poggio Antico.


y
Bucelas
Fairly crisp Portuguese white wine
Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. (<br />(ShellFish) Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc.
<b>Principally made of Arinto, this once popular wine of Victorian England is again reaching markets from wineries in the DOC Bucelas region just north of Lisbon.</b> Besides a crisp version for matching with Fish and Shellfish, it is also available in Sparkling Wine and sweet dessert wine versions. 


2ry
Burgundy (Bourgogne) 
Bourgogne province of eastern France.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka La Bourgogne): <b>Burgundy is the English name for the vast region of Bourgogne which includes the regions of Côte d’Or and Chablis, along with the Côte Chalonnaise and Maconnais.</b> While renown for some of the Grand Cru and Premier Cru incomparable Chardonnays and Pinot noirs of these regions, Bourgogne includes a much vaster territory including Bourgogne-Passe-Tous-Grains, an area producing enjoyable and affordable lighter red wines that employ Pinot Noir and Gamay; the Côte Chalonnaise, producing pleasing wines from varieties of wine grapes including Aligoté and Gamay; and Máconnais, which is noted, among other things, for producing distinctive perfumed, high-acid whites from the Aligoté grape. While at one time Bourgogne had full administrative responsibility for Beaujolais, during the Napoleonic era Beaujolais was spun off with administrative responsibility split between Saône et Loire and Rhône. Even though it is an English word, use of the term Burgundy is restricted and when used on wines produced outside of France or not covered by International trade agreements, the term simply means a generic red wine or white wine made from any grapes the producers choose to use, so when you discover a “Burgundy” from Africa, Asia or the Americas, lower your expectations.


r
CABERNET FRANC
Eleventh most planted red grape
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The strength of this winegrape when used for blending or turned into a varietal wine is that it offers an excellent structure with a firm edge and is quite appealing as a match for braised, roasted or grilled red meats.</b>  When crushed it fills the air with impressive blueberry-like aromas, although winemakers have a hard time capturing these ethereal scents in the finished wine. Genetically linked as a parent to Cabernet Sauvignon, it is dependably early-ripening and serves as an important blending wine for red Bordeaux. More importantly, it serves as the prime grape in the relatively light reds of the Loire Valley and as a major grape in Southwest France and in Northeast Italy. It is the world's eleventh most planted red grape and many think the highest expression of Cabernet Franc is found in the Bordeaux First Growth Cheval Blanc.  


r
CABERNET SAUVIGNON
World's most popular red wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A red winegrape capable of producing prestigious, medium-bodied, well-structured and very clean wines across the palate. It is arguably the most popular varietal red wine in the world, but, without challenge, has become the world's most planted winegrape during the past forty years.</b> While especially known for its black-currant (cassis-like) aromas, other complexities can appear ranging from black pepper to mint and bell pepper to almost grassy overtones. Traditionally it is the heart of the wines produced by top-rated wineries in the Haut-Médoc region of Bordeaux. As a varietal wine this late-ripening red vinifera cross (Cabernet FrancXSauvignon Blanc) is offered as an upscale wine in most New World viticultural areas and is, for example, successfully producing impressive dry red table wines for the renewed wine industry of India as well as for the fast emerging wine industry of Argentina. The grape accounts for the most acclaimed and highest priced wines of California’s Napa Valley and Sonoma regions as well as the wines produced on the Terra Rosa soils of the Coonawarra region in Australia. While Cabernet Sauvignons can be astringent when young, they become increasingly valued for their complexity, distinctive bouquet and complex flavors when patiently aged under proper wine storage conditions. 


r
Cahors
Concentrated, velvety Malbecs.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>In the Southwest region of France, the Cohors appellation is the principal home for both Malbec (aka Auxerrois) and also, along with the Madiran appellation, has substantial plantings of Tannat, another deep red winegrape variety.</b> Within the overall production of wine from this Southwest France region, a limited number of barrel-aged special cuvées are being offered delivering concentrated and velvety versions of the Malbec grape, blended along with Tannat and/or Merlot.</b> These are the product of long maceration time and barrel aging. The appellation control wines are required to be 70% or more Malbec. The less interesting wines are of the same blend but lack the special attention given to the barrel-aged offerings. 


r
CARIGNAN
Sixth most planted red grape variety.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
(aka Cariñena and Mazuelo in Spain; also spelled Carignane & Carignano): <b>Capable of producing naturally well-balanced wines and important in both Europe and the New World, Carignan is sixth in rank of the world's most planted red grape varieties.</b> However, because it is easily grown and generous in its yield, it is commonly used to produce agreeable everyday food wines of no prestige. Occasionally the grape has a chance to display its ripe cherry fruit aromas,  layered appeal, length and distinction. Given the availability of some very old and low vigor vineyards in Spain and in the Languedoc, Carignan may soon become one of the next ‘rediscovery’ wines of both the Spanish and French winemakers, as they continue to explore the potential of some of their older, but previously overlooked varietital grapes. Similar interest has surfaced in Chile and recent Wine Judging events in California suggest this may also become a rewarding discovery by New World winemakers.  


r
CARMENÈRE
Grape catching renewed interest
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>One of the most important red varietals of Chile, its attributes are that it offers suppleness together with aromatic interest similar to Merlot</b>.  While once an important grape in Bordeaux blends, it was believed to have disappeared from French vineyards after the phylloxera devastation of the late-eighteen hundreds and was essentially replaced by Merlot. Rediscovered to have survived as a major grape used in the production of some excellent red wines in Chile, it is catching renewed attention as these wines reach International markets.  


r
CARNELIAN
Well-balanced red wines.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.<br /
<b>These winegrapes generally produce well-balanced red wines of good color and body.</b> The variety was developed by University of California at Davis from Grenache, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon and has found a home in some difficult growing conditions.

CATAWBA
Native American labrusca-hybrid
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres.
<b>A native American labrusca-variety hybrid.</b> The wine can reach market as a red, white, or pink wine but is most noteworthy as a Sparkling Wine. The wines can also range from dry to quite sweet. 


F
Cava
Spanish effervescent wine.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
<b>A very popular Sparkling Wine with worldwide distribution.</b> It is mostly produced in the Penedès wine producing zone of the Cataluña portion of Spain, but which is permitted to also originate from other regions of the country. The base wine of Cava is essentially composed of blends of the three grape varieties Macabeo, Xarel-lo and Parellada. The two dominant producers of Cava (and two of the largest producers of sparkling wines in the world, Codorníu and Freixenet, also became major producers of appealing Sparkling Wines in California, where their chosen base wines became the same varieties used in the most prestigious Champagnes (Pinot noir and Chardonnay). These varieties are also gradually finding their way back into Cava and the Sparkling Wines of Spain.


y
CAYUGA WHITE
Agreeable whites and sparklers.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b>Agreeable white table wines and sparkling wines are produced by some North American wineries from this hybrid developed by New York’s Geneva Experiment Station.</b> However, Lambrusca-like tones can become prominent in the finished wine when the fruit is picked too ripe.

Chablis
One of World’s top Chardonnays.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. <br />(ShellFish) Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. 
<b>Chablis is unreservedly proclaimed to be one of the world’s most distinguished white wines.</b> Its best wines are distinctive, dry, crisp, hard, steely and quite memorable, with a somewhat 'nutty' quality showing up with bottle age. It is produced entirely from Chardonnay grown in this most northerly area of Bourgogne, and as an appellation is quite separate from the rest of the rest of the region. The area experiences long, hard winters and is climatically closer to Champagne (which once served as a market for its grapes), than to any other part of Bourgogne. When wines bear this name but originate from any other viticultural area, the producer has simply borrowed the word without even trying to emulate the product.


r
Chambertin
Exceptional Pinot noirs  
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Exceptional Pinot noirs are produced on this Côte de Nuits hillside site.</b> The Grand Cru Chambertin site was annexed by Gevrey into its appellation in 1847 and the town hyphenated the famous vineyard into its name. It is regarded as possibly the finest red vineyard of the Côte d’Or. See Gevrey-Chambertin.


2ry
Chambolle-Musigny
Rich, velvety Pinot noirs.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Rich, velvety, rather elegant Pinot noirs are produced within this Côte de Nuits appellation. </b>Two Grand Cru vineyards are at this site, Le Musigny and Bonnes Mares (part of which lies in Morey-St-Denis) and 24 Premiers Crus. The Le Musigny vineyard is regarded as one of the pinnacle vineyards of the Côtes de Nuits for delicate and lacy reds and for the small amount of Chardonnay that is also produced.


r
CHAMBOURCIN
Grape delivers aromatic red wines.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>This relatively recent French hybrid produces a deeply colored and aromatic red wine</b>.  A vigorous grapevine that proved an immediate hit when introduced in Muscadet (it has since been banned in France as part of the country's continuing effort to be rid of the hybrid grape varieties, but it has not disappeared). The grape appears to have a good future in New South Wales, Australia, and has been a welcome addition to east coast sections of Australia that experience warm, damp climates.


F
Champagne
World’s most famous Sparkling Wine.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres, but also an excellent accompaniment to serve with most food choices. 
<b>The winemakers of the French region of Champagne did not originate Sparkling Wine, but they did perfect it.</b> So much so, in fact, the name of their provence became the generic name for Sparkling Wine produced anywhere in the world and produced from any grapes available to those winemakers. As the result, the Champagne region needed to go to extraordinary efforts over the past century to recapture their region’s name and gained, by French law and, starting in 1927, by international trade agreements, the exclusive right to not only the name Champagne, but to Méthode Champenoise and the words Champagne Méthode. The argument presented was that their area produces distinctive and unparalleled wines due to the combination of soil conditions, a severe climate (less than prime for normal table wines) and a disciplined method of production that merited special protection. Therefore, they argued, the use of the term Champagne for products other than their unique product seriously misled and confused the wine buyer. As the result, “Champagne” on a label now means the wine is produced in the Champagne region under appellation control; is made from one or more of the three grapes grown in the district (the red and productive variety Pinot Meunier (see Meunier), Pinot noir and Chardonnay). However the wine is far from standardized: it is offered in colors ranging from clear (or light golden) to rouge; in dry- to noticeably sweet-balance; and it ranges between sparkling wines produced from a specific vineyard; wines that are or are not vintage dated; wines re-fermented in their bottle; produced by a bottle transfer process; or by the bulk Charmat processing technique.  The production is dominated by Möet plus six other major Champagne houses which produce some 70% of the region's total production. There is also a red table wine produced in the region from Pinot Meunier.

CHARDONNAY
World’s most popular white wine.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
<b>Under a wide range of names, the wines made of Chardonnay are both the most popular and prestigious dry white wines in the World</b>. They range considerably in character but are usually firm in structure, medium-bodied, supple in texture and well-balanced -- no matter the region of their origin. Chardonnay is also the most widely planted white winegrape. When not overridden by oak barrel tones, the aromas show apple and pear-like scents and can carry these qualities into in a lengthy aftertaste.  Produced by so many wineries and in so many regions, it is advisable to ask for a description of a Chardonnay with which you are unfamiliar before ordering a bottle in a restaurant or purchasing the wine in a shop.  The usual way of serving the wine is slightly chilled. It will take on the distinctive complexities inherent from various oaks when fermented or aged in small barrels or otherwise exposed to oak. As an introduction to the range of character possible in producing this wine it is enlightening to try a glass of an oak scented St. Véran and compare it to a steely, crisp, Chablis. It is also the white grape used to make some of the most prestigious sparkling wines of the world, as well as being used to produce sweet dessert wines, but less successfully.

The Grand Cru Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet is entirely within the village and it shares the Le Montrachet and Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Crus with Puligny. Among its 19 Premiers Crus Les Chenevottes, Clos de la Maltroie, En Cailleret and Les Ruchottes are best known. The whites have a reputation for steely power and the Premier Cru of La Boudriotte and Morgeot produce outstanding reds.

Châteauneuf-Du-Pape 
Prestigious, Grenache-based reds.

<b>A prestigious, relatively full-bodied, supple-textured, dark red wine with a somewhat Pomegranate/Cranberry-like flavor impression</b>.  It is produced in a limestone-dominated growing area in the southern Rhône region of France (Avignon) and the name is derived from the building of a summer home for the Roman Catholic Pope in the 14th Century. This was the first area in France to establish appellation control for production of its wine and the alcohol level must be 12.5% or higher, all achieved without the addition of sugar. A small amount of early-drinking, full-bodied white wine is also produced. Its contemporary wines are based mainly on Grenache, with Syrah adding structure and Mourvédre playing an important role in the blend (although another ten varieties are allowed to be used).

(aka Steen in South Africa): <b>At its aromatic heights, this white grape delivers aromas reminiscent of ripe melons, pears and peaches</b>. Most frequently winemakers leave some natural grape sugar in the finished wine.  It is the dominant white grape of the middle and upper parts of the Loire Valley where it successfully produces everything from Crémants to great Botrytis-enriched dessert wines. Produced in a cold grape growing climate like Loire, its acidity level is such it will drink like a dry white, whether or not the producers have left in an appreciable amount of residual sugar. It may appear successfully in a dry style, a slightly sweet fruity style; as a Sparkling Wine; or, as either a naturally sweet or fortified dessert wine. One of the most popular and versatile white wines of the world, the grape is the twelfth most planted white. Its characteristic high natural retention of acidity makes it very suitable for warm-climate wine production. The wine is also effectively used in blending in order to give a lift and heightened interest to wines offering only limited character of their own. In the Loire Valley of France, it is the grape producing Vouvray and Pineau de la Loire and shows remarkable ability to age gracefully and gain intriguing nuances of complexity with careful cellaring. Before ordering or buying a Chenin Blanc you have not previously tried, it is well to seek advice regarding the style of the wine and sweetness level.

It serves as a most suitable accompaniment with roasted meats and hearty food preparations and has been adopted as the table wine of choice in Argentina. While one of the six permissible grapes used in Bordeaux wines, its presence was reduced severely by frost damage in Bordeaux so its European home seems to be mainly in Madiron and Cohors in Southwest France. Since the Malbecs from Argentina's Mendoza region are reaching markets throughout the world, they are giving Malbecs a renewed chance to find fame as a winegrape. Given its new popularity, the vine is being successfully introduced into many New World vineyards.

<b> This white grape is popularly offered in a sweet, fragrant and soft style with hints of spice and the suggestion of a lime blossom tone</b>.  It finds agreeable service as an attractive afternoon or after-dinner sipping wine and serves well with fresh fruit and desserts. Before bottling its juice has to be protected from rapid oxidation and the traditional way to do this was to fortify it with neutral alcohol. However, improved winemaking equipment and refrigeration makes this unnecessary and some producers refer to Malvasia Bianca as the ‘Queen of the Muscats'. The grape is also found in a wide array of winemaking styles and the grape is used in everything from sparkling wine to a varietal Madeira.

It is the dominant grape variety along the right bank of the Gironde River in Bordeaux and popular in North America. Some outstanding Merlots are produced in both Washington State and northern California. This grape's leading standard bearer is the Pomerol region's Chateau Pétrus.

<b>Immediately to the south of the city of Bordeaux, Pessac-Léognan became its own appellation in 1987, stripping GRAVES of its most important producers.</b> Suddenly this became a new and very prestigious Bordeaux appellation, it includes wine producers that are both historically and currently important to the high reputation of premium Bordeaux wines. Leading producers of red wines in this appellation include Haut Brion, La Mission Haut Brion and Pape Clément. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are the principal red grapes. Its leading producers of white wines are Dom. de Chevalier, and Chx. Haut-Brion, Laville-Haut-Brion and Couhins-Lurton (20% of the total wine production is white and these wines are a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon). 


r
PETIT VERDOT
Red Bordeaux blending wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. 
<b>One of the six grapes currently approved for blended into Bordeaux, this grapevine has been introduced in the majority of wine growing regions in the world but its wines only occasionally turn up under its varietal identity.</b> It is always worth tasting but its important role in Bordeaux is its use in making up for deficiencies in Bordeaux-type wine blends, such as when a dollop of deep red color is needed in a blend to bring the wine to a market-valued color. In warmer climates plantings in Australia and California it delivers agreeable depth and interesting flavors that complement richly seasoned foods.


r
PETITE SIRAH
Blackberry scented wine.
<br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc. <br />(SpicyFoods) Agreeable Matches For Highly Spiced Or Hotly Seasoned Foods.
(aka Durif): <b>Fairly popular medium-bodied wines are made in California from this red grape which show blackberry scents and firm structure</b>.  Created in the southern Rhone region by botanist Dr. Durif as a cross of Syrah and Peloursin, it is proving fairly successful in the dry climate of northern California, where a wide range of wineries have, in recent years, turned it from a deep colored, tannic, long-maturing wine into a relatively fruit-forward, food-friendly, competitively priced red table wine. Particularly appealing versions have been released from regions including Napa, Sonoma, Lake County and Paso Robles. After showing renewed success in the marketplace, the variety is now rebounding in popularity in Australia and Israel as well as rebounding in other viticultural areas in the Americas.


r
Pic-Saint-Loup
Robust red of Languedoc.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Some of the most enjoyable robust red wines of the Languedoc are offered under this name</b>. It is produced in an area to the north of Montpellier</b>. To bear this appellation identity on its label the wines must include ninety percent or more wine made from Syrah, Grenache and/or Mourvèdre grapes.


r
PINOTAGE
Major South Africa red grape.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>This red grape is capable of producing a rich, deep colored wine with suggestions of a wild fruitiness</b>.  Originated at the Stellenbosch University as a cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, it is a major red wine in South Africa and offered by many of its wineries. The grape is also slowly becoming a varietal offered by other New World wineries. 


y
PINOT BLANC
Subtle and not very forward.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.<br /> Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. 
(aka Pinot Bianco): <b>A white grape variety that is most often relatively full-bodied, subtle but not very forward in varietal character. It sometimes carries a slightly smokey tone or can be mildly spicy</b>.  It was first discerned as a white mutation of Pinot Gris. It is found mainly grown in Austrian and Alsatian vineyards, where it is used to produce reserved food-friendly wines.  


y
PINOT GRIGIO
Refreshing white wines.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.<br /> Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
(aka Pinot Gris): <b>This white grape is increasing in popularity for producing a pleasing, refreshing wine with forward flavors.</b> It may as frequently appear in International markets under this, its Italian name, as it does under its French name, Pinot Gris.  The wine provides excellent service as an agreeable accompaniment for dinner and is deserving of popularity as a 'pick it up and serve it for dinner' accompaniment for multi-dish dinners and vegetarian foods. Theoretically, there is a difference in style between Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio. As the latter, it is expected to present a slightly more assertive presence in the mouth, be in a richer style and show forward flavors. 


y
PINOT GRIS
Gaining in popularity.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.<br /> (Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc. 
(aka Pinot Grigio, Rülander, etc.): <b>An attractive, refreshing and somewhat perfumed white wine gaining in popularity and readily found as a varietal in vineyards and wine markets around the world</b>.  A mutation of the Pinot noir grapevine, it can still be found in some old Pinot noir vineyards where it contributes to both the mouthfeel and structure of some of the various clones of its red wine cousin. In any case, both Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio are most agreeable when served chilled. Welcomed into vineyards throughout the world, in the northern American State of Oregon (where wine from this grape must be labeled as Pinot Gris) it has largely replaced both Chardonnay and Riesling as the white grape of choice. Note that when found as Pinot-gris d'Alsace, the character will be more like Pinot Grigio with very forward flavors.

PINOT NOIR
Seventh most widely planted red.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka Spätburgunder) <b>This widely heralded red wine is medium-bodied and only mildly tannic, but it is loved by a great many wine enthusiasts for its relatively supple, at times almost velvety, feel on the palate and for its great length.</b> Recognition of the special qualities of this grape variety extend back in history for way more than a thousand years and enthusiasts take delight in its appealing cherry and lilac-like fruit tones as well as its sometimes great complexity. From favorable years in Burgundy's Côte d’Or and when grown where extreme climate range is not a problem, Pinot noir has also shown amazing ability to improve in the bottle and gain impressive complexity as it ages. Exceptional wines from the Côte d’Or have served as an inspiration for winemakers throughout the world but efforts to replicate the appeal of the best of the Côte de Nuits Pinot noirs have proven a daunting challenge. Yet, the resulting wines have proven well-worth the effort and this grape is currently the world's seventh most grown variety. While it is a decidedly demanding vine in terms of its site-specific demand for perfect soil and cool-climate growing conditions, it has produced a great many good wines although relatively few have yet matched the high goals of their winemakers.  Noteworthy New World success has been achieved from vineyard sites in North America's Willamette Valley of Oregon and in California's Russian River Valley, Sonoma Coast, Carneros, Santa Lucia Highlands and Arroyo Grande appellations. The grape has also become a noteworthy success in New Zealand and is the most planted red variety in the nation and covers three quarters of Central Otago's vineyards. In Europe, plantings of Pinot noir are significantly increasing in Germany. Besides yielding exceptional table wines, a major role is played by Pinot noir in many of the World's most highly regarded Champagnes and Sparkling Wines. Pinot noir is the 7th largest red grape planting in the world.


r
Pomerol
Some of world's best Merlots.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>It may seem strange that Ch. Pétrus did not make it into the famous Bordeaux Classification of 1855, but it was on the wrong side of a river that had few bridges and its market was France and the Netherlands, not England</b>. Furthermore, its wine was made from Merlot, not Cabernet Sauvignon.  Still, it has been consistently one of the highest priced of all Bordeaux wines and fabled for its appealing complexities and length in the finish. Other outstanding Pomerol producers include Le Pin, Lafeur, La Fleur-Pétrus and L’Église Clinet. The grape variety of the area is overwhelmingly Merlot. Some Cabernet Franc is found but there is almost no Cabernet Sauvignon present.  


r
Pommard
Site of powerful Pinot noirs.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Pommard lies between Volnay and Beaune and has the reputation of producing some of the most powerful, deep, and sturdy red wines of the Côte de Beaune.</b> While there are no Grand Cru designations in Pommard, several of the 27 Premier Cru vineyards are frequently mentioned as candidates for that honor. In fact, the reason for the absence of a Grand Cru designation may simply be laid back on the remarkable humility of its leading winemaker when the original rating took place. Some of the most impressive vineyards are Les Pèzerolles, Les Chanlins, Les Jarolières, Les Fremiers, Les Rugiens, Clos de la Commaraine, Les Cos Blanc and Les Arlelets.  


2dr
Port
Sweet, luscious & high alcohol.
Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit.
<b>These wines are usually sweet and luscious on the palate and high in alcohol</b>. The classic Port wines made in the City of Oporto are wines from the third region in the world (in 1756) to establish controls over such details as the specific varieties of grapes permitted to be used to make a wine; where the grapes can be grown; how the wines are made; and, how the wines are to be labeled. While the grapes for Portuguese Port are actually grown and fermented high in Portugal’s Douro River Valley, the wines are aged and blended into the various versions of Port in the coastal City of Oporto. The process starts at the wineries with prime, ripened grapes but the fermentation is stopped by the addition of brandy in order to preserve the wine’s sweetness.  The highest grade and most prestigious Ports are the <b>Vintage Ports</b> which must be approved for quality by the IVDP, the Port industry's governing agency, before being sold or shipped from Portugal. Part of the unspoken mandate placed on this agency is to assure that there is never a glut of Vintage Porto on the world markets or instability in the price. Vintage Ports are bottled when only two years old but can benefit from twenty or more years of aging in bottle, and last for many decades. The fruitiest Ports are those labeled <b>Ruby</b> and are bottled with but a few years of age. <b>Tawny Ports</b> are given lengthy aging in barrels for as many as forty or more years and can be very complex. The main market for the Ruby, and even many of the Tawny, has traditionally been France. <b>Crusted Ports</b> are produced by a process that attempts to abbreviate the aging process that produces the outstanding flavors and sensual qualities that are produced by patient aging in Vintage Ports.  <b>White Ports</b> are also produced but have not reached similar popularity and acceptance. By contrast, the product of this enclave in Portugal have been so popular that 'Port' wines are produced by many producers throughout the world out of whatever grapes they grow and by whatever process through which they can make a replica product. Some of these wines are actually based on the varieties grown in the Douro Valley and the wines are made to standards faithful to those followed in Portugal. However, the wines readily available in world-wide markets and simply labeled as 'Port' originated from other sources than the shippers from Oporto are not in any way held to the standards to which the Portuguese products are held. Ports are popular for afternoon sipping with cheese or appetizers or consumed as an after-dinner wine. The high alcohol helps preserve Ports and can result in very-long lived wines. Outstanding Portuguese producers include Quinta do Noval, Taylor, Dow, Warre, Graham and Fonseca, among others. 


y
Pouilly-Fuissé
Full-bodied Chardonnays.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The full-bodied and ripe tasting Chardonnays from the Máconnais district of Burgundy have earned high-praise.</b> The wines are entirely produced from Chardonnay and see about a year's aging before release. While not considered quite on par with the elegance and memorable appeal found in the best wines from the Côte de Beaune, they have many qualities to appreciate. Vineyard sources are frequently identified on many of the labels.

Pouilly-Fumé
Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.<br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
<b>Usually a well-structured wine having a perfumed character and, for some, the hint of a smoky or gun-powder tone.</b> This is a noteworthy and often distinguished white wine produced from Loire Valley region Sauvignon Blanc and is similar to Sancerre. Its leading producers include Dagueneau.


r
PRIMITIVO
Closely related to Zinfandel.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>This close relative to Zinfandel produces firm, well-balanced red table wines that are, on average, a touch less focused on fruit than California Zinfandel, even when the Primativo vine is planted in California vineyards</b>.  Introduced to the Puglia region from the Dalmatian archipelago during the same time period as Zinfandel arrived in the United States at east-coast nurseries, the Italian fruit took on value for its potential range in style and for producing useful blending wines that were shipped to cooler Northern grape growing regions, rather than as a varietal. It has now gained new life in its identify as a marketable variant of the popular Zinfandel table wine grape of California.


r
Priorat
Old-vine Garnachas & Carignans.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A region in Tarragona that has sprung back to life during the past twenty years and has already built an international reputation for offering outstanding red wines, often with a stone-like minerality.</b>  Its impressive first wines have been produced from old-vine Garnacha and Carignan grapes, often blended with a mix of more recent plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Younger vine Garnacha and Carignan also play an important role in the cépage. Winemakers from all over the world have converged on Priorat, working side by side with a handful of local families who are resurrecting their derelict and/or previously under-appreciated vines and vineyards.  


F
PROSECCO
Base wine for Spumante.
Sipping Or Easy-Drinking Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
<b>A grape of fairly neutral character native to the Veneto section of Italy and mainly used as the base wine in either a lightly effervescent white wine called Frizzante or the Italian Sparkling Wine, Spumante</b>. Prosecco  now appears frequently as the varietal identity of a sparkling wine. As with any sparkling wine, the distinctive character or one Prosecco over another is achieved by the quality of the base wines and whatever is added in the tirage and dosage.


y
Puligny-Montrachet
Powerful Chardonnays.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The whites of Puligny are powerful and meaty with hints of marzipan, golden apples, warm butter, toasted almond and honey</b>. The Montrachet and Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Crus are shared with Chassagne but the Chevalier-Montrachet  and Bienvenues-Bâtard are entirely within Puligny. In addition there are 17 Premiers Crus.

Rhône - Northern 
Great Syrahs and Viognier. 
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>The narrow mountain valley region that is the home of the Syrah grape vine which clings tenaciously to sometimes steep vineyard sites.</b> This is the long stretch where the Rhône River takes its plunge between the gentle landscape where Beaujolais is produced and the rich plain and easy Mediterranean climate of the Southern Rhône. While Syrah is by far the dominant red, the white grape varieties are Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. Within the far Northern area are the Côte de Rhône appellations of Côte Rôtie, Ch. Grillet and Condrieu. Next comes St. Joseph and then Tain l’Hermitage, Tournon, Crozie Hermitage and Cornas, Hermitage. Only about 5% of the total wine made in the Rhône is produced in this Northern area, half of which is produced by Crozie Hermitage, but the region is certainly the center for wine collectors interest.

Rhône - Southern 
Mostly blended red wines.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>A gentle Mederranean-climate region that produces more wine than any other section of France, except Bordeaux.</b> Although some Syrah is grown, the main winegrape varieties are Grenache, Mourvèdre, Carignan, and Cinsault, as well as the white grape Ugni Blanc. In all some 27 grape varieties are found contributing to the wines of the Southern Rhône. The area’s main appellations of interest are Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas, and Tavel. Most of the wine production reaches market as Côtes du Rhône and Côtes du Rhône Villages

<b>Indisputably one of the most distinguished white wine grapes in the world for the production of table wines and dessert wines</b>.  The vine is widely cultivated in cold viticultural regions and is the flag-bearing varietal wine for Germany, where it will be marked Kabinett when finished as a dry white and as Spätlese when finished with a perceptable sweetness. For even sweeter versions see RIESLING-Dessert. It ranges in character from the light-bodied, floral-toned, enticing wines of the <b>Mosel</b>, the firmer and complex wines of the <b>Nahe</b> Valley, to the steely-edged, long-lived wines grown in various other districts in the vicinity of the Rhine River. With age, the wines can carry an intriguing hint of a kerosine-like note in their aromas. While strongly identified with German winemaking, wines made from Riesling grape are found in cold-climate viticultural sites around the world and it is the ninth most widely cultivated white wine grape in the world. It produces memorable and rewarding wines in Alsace, Australia, Austria and in the North American regions of Mendocino County (CA), Michigan, Ontario, Niagara Peninsula and in parts of the Columbia Valley in Washington State.

Rioja
Distinguished red Tempranillos.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Region in Spain producing some of the world's most age-worthy and distinguished red wines.</b> The wines are primarily produced from the Tempranillo grape (which accounts for approximately two-thirds of the region’s total plantings and production) but the wines usually surface as a blend with lesser amounts of Garnacha (or with small amounts of two other red varieties in Riojas of the Marquis de, Carignane and Graciano), which help add body and an appealing rounder mouthfeel. By special disposition, Cabernet Sauvignon can also be found in the wines of the Marqués de Riscal. The Rioja is a region of 20,000 growers and over 500 wineries. (For the white wine of Rioja see VIURA).

<b>Rosé is defined as a wine finished with a pink or light red color</b>.  The required method in much of Europe is to produce a rosé by leaving red wine grapes skins with the crushed juice a short time before completion of fermentation and just long enough to gain the desired color. Another method, one being discontinued in Champagne production, achieves its desired color by blending a small amount of finished red wine back into white wine.

St. Émilion
Quick maturing Bordeaux reds.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>"St. Émilion produces wines that have enormous crowd appeal," </b>writes Bordeaux critic Robert Parker. He elaborates by describing them as “fleshy, quick maturing, round and generous, they are easy to like, easy to drink and easy to understand." The wines are mainly produced from Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes (Cheval Blanc is a lead wine of St. Émilion and unique in being the only highly esteemed Bordeaux made primarily from Cabernet Franc). The vines are grown on a great diversity of soil types. While many are certainly quick aging, others are made to last a hundred years. The two most prestigious producers are Chx Ausone and Cheval Blanc, while other leading producers include Chx. Angélus, Pavoe, Figeac and Troplong-Mondot.

St. Estèphe
Northerly Bordeaux district.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>While the red wines from this area have had the reputation of being slow to mature, a change in winemaking techniques has succeeded in producing supple wines enjoyable in their youthful years.</b> One of the most northerly of the important appellations of Bordeaux, this is an area where the soil is more clay-based than gravelly. The drainage is slower and gives its vines an advantage in hot drought years but not in wet years. Lead producers from the area are Cos d’Estournel and Montrose.

St. Julien
High regard Haut-Medoc area.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>"Nowhere in Bordeaux is the art of winemaking practiced as highly as in St. Julien.  Consequently the wine consumer has the odds stacked in his, or her, favor when purchasing a St. Julien"</b> wrote Robert Parker, in the latest edition of his book on Bordeaux.  This Haut-Medoc appellation is along the Atlantic side of the Gironde River and immediately south of Pauillac. St-Julien has five flagship estates: Léoville-Barton, Léoville-Poyerré, Léoville-Las-Cases, Ducru-Beaucaillou and Gruaud Larose. In addition, well worth noting are the wines from Gloria and Brainaire.

Santenay
Rustic Pinot noirs that age well.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. 
<b>Santenay vines grow in vineyards that have a high percentage of marl that has led towards reds needing a bit of aging before they drink well but many tasters then find interesting Kirsch and leather tones they then find attractive in the wines.</b> The village has eleven Premiers Crus and a lead producer is Vincent Girardin.

Sauternes
Famed dessert wines.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Dessert) Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit, Also Serve With Foie Gras.
<b>Some of the most distinguished and highly valued sweet white dessert wines of the world are offered under the Bordeaux appellation control areas identified as Sauternes and Barsac.</b> While the white table wines from these areas are usually good to excellent, the sweet dessert wines are outstanding and show a wonderfully aromatic honied character. This is the result of a mold (botrytis cinerea) that causes water loss within the grapes through evaporation even while concentrating the sugars. The clusters look repulsive and are hard to press but the small amount of juice that the winemakers are able to extract for fermentation produces memorable wines. The white grape varieties in Sauternes are Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. By far the lead producer is Ch. d’Yquem but other exceptional producers include Chx de Fargues, Raymond-Lafon, Rieussec and Suduiraut.

SAUVIGNON BLANC
Fifth most widely planted white.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
(aka Sancerre, Pouilly-Fumé, and Fumé Blanc) <b>The aromas range widely showing floral and the tropical notes of passion fruit, lichee nut and grapefruit at one end of its spectrum and at the other end pronounced herbaceous tones, ranging from the fragrance of fresh cut grass and vegetal smells and, at the extreme, cat pee.</b>  Anywhere along this spectrum the grape produces a beautifully structured wine complementing a broad array of foods and doing outstanding service as a palate refresher. The fifth most widely planted of the white wine grapes, Sauvignon Bland has been a success almost everywhere it has been introduced. It has been the driving force of New Zealand’s successful international wine trade and, for the renewed wine industry of India it has proven to be one of its most successful early offerings. While many winemakers produce this wine in stainless steel without any exposure to oak, others have made appealing wines by barrel fermentation or by aging their freshly fermented wine in oak. This helps temper the grape's herbaceous inclinations while adding complexity and enrichment. Additionally, it is either the base or an ingredient in many of the world’s most highly regarded dessert wines (see SAUTERNES).

<b>In its most prestigious use, this white grape serves as the heart of many exceptional sweet dessert wines, such as Chateau d’Yquem.</b> The grape is frequently blended with Sauvignon Blanc and both grape varieties contribute to the appealing qualities of other great Sauternes dessert wines as well as in the production of appealing dry table wines in Pessac Léognan and in other sections of Bordeaux and elsewhere where the two varieties are both grown. It is the base for attractive dry or semi-sweet white wines in Australia and South Africa. In less accomplished versions it offers a slightly soft and agreeable table wine with a somewhat fruity character and is light- to medium-bodied.

Sherry
Well-loved fortified wine.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
<b>A stable, fortified wine, Spanish Sherry can range from 15.5% in alcohol to those approaching 24%.</b> It comes in a great range of styles from completely dry to rich, very complex dessert-style wines.  For example, the charmingly nutty <b>Amontillados</b> can range from completely dry to medium-dry to sweet, and again, <b>Olorosos</b> similarly range from completely dry to medium-dry to sweet. In addition, the dry <b>Fino</b> style is popular and there are a series of the easy sipping <b>Cream Sherries</b>, as well as the distinctive <b>Pedro Ximènez</b>, a varietal bottling showing an intense sweetness. Since the turn of the millennium, an additional two new classifications have been offered, <b>VOS</b> (Very Old Sherry) blends at least 20 years old) and <b>VORS</b> (Very Rare Old Sherry) blends at least 30 years old). By international agreement, Sherry is a product made in the Jerez de la Frontera region of Spain. However, Sherry production is an ancient process well known throughout the world and the name is in wide use. Essentially fermented wine is systematically oxidized, aged in oak, stabilized with the use of grape spirits and turned into a stable product that can easily be shipped or stored without changing character or deteriorating. Efforts by the producers to limit the name of Sherry to the Spanish product has been less than entirely successful. The name ‘Sherry’ is etched on a wide variety of intentionally oxidized wines produced in a great many places, in addition to Spain.

SHIRAZ
Robust version of Syrah.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka Syrah): <b>Shiraz offerings tend to be a robust and forward version of Syrah and sometimes focus on the exotic, chocolate and sweet ripe fruit qualities the grape can reveal.</b> Although the original cuttings for Australia Shiraz came from Syrah vines in the northern Rhône Valley, the actual wine produced from the new vineyards varied considerably from the supple and subtle wines of the northern Rhône due to the marked difference  in viticultural conditions (including generally warmer climates). Since the wines tasted differently, and since the grape variety was assumed to have originated in Persia, the name ìShirazî was adopted and became the popular name given to the red Syrah grape by winemakers in Australia, South Africa and by many other New World producers who consider their wines closer in style to wines identified as Shiraz than to wines sold as Syrah.

SILVANER
Ancient & enjoyable white wine.

(aka: Sylvaner in Alsace, GrünerSilvaner, GrosRhein and as Johannisberg in Switzerland): <b>The grape produces a subtlety flavored white, firmly structured wine, ranging from light- to full-bodied wines of good acidity. </b> The wine is produced from an early-ripening white grape grown extensively in the colder viticultural climates of northern and central Europe. The reign of Silvaner as a major European wine seems to have been superseded in many areas by Müller-Thurgau, although efforts to bring it back to public awareness continues in the Rheinhessen and it remains an important grape in Slovenia, Hungary and Russia.

<b> A dry white wine produced within the Soave appellation at Verona in the Veneto region of Italy. </b> The wine has a distinctive, if hard-to-describe, character somehow combining melon, mineral and spice tones. Soave is mostly produced from the Garganega grape, but it is sometimes sharpened, broadened or stretched by the addition of Trebbiano di Soave (Verdicchio) or by Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and/or Trebbiano Toscano. A dessert wine labeled <b>Ricioto di Soave</b> is produced by crushing raisined grapes.

Sparkling Wine
Basic identity for Bubblys. 
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres and the complete range of other foods. 
(aka as Cava in Spain; Spumante in Italy; Sekt in Germany; and, as Champagne, Crémant and Mousseux in France): <b>Sparkling Wine is the basic identity of effervescent wines and can range from crisp and dry to quite sweet and range from being almost clear of color to red</b>. Sparkling wine producers from the Champagne district of France have the exclusive use of their place name but Sparkling Wine production takes place nearly everywhere that wine grapes are grown and almost every variety of grape has been tested at one time by someone as a base for producing appealing effervescent wines. Many of these products are outstanding and stand among the best wines produced in the world. This effervescent wine is often served at receptions and parties to give the event a festive mood, but it is also, due partially to high acidity, extraordinarily successful as a palate-cleansing dinner wine suitable for any meal, including those spanning a wide variety of dishes of different flavors, textures and seasonings.<br />  Limited in their capacity to expand production within their tightly defined and controlled district, Champagne producers used the prosperity they gained after World War II to invest and involve themselves in the production of Sparkling Wines in various countries throughout the world, both through the ownership of wineries or as consultants. Where suitable, they have sometimes used one or more of the three varieties of grapes permitted to be used in Champagne.  <br/><br/>THE SPARKLING WINE PROCESS: A Sparkling Wine is successfully achieved in one of three ways. The three methods all start with producing a still wine and the quality and character of this wine is one of the critical elements determining the taste and aftertaste of the final product. In the premium fermented-in-this-bottle method the wine is induced to go through a secondary fermentation in its original bottle through the addition of a liqueur containing sugar, select yeasts and a carefully formulated blend of other ingredients that will give the finished wine the distinctive proprietary character that distinguishes one producer's brand from another. Following fermentation the wine is racked to clear it of sediment, then a final dosage is added before final packaging to set the level of sweetness of the wine to be shipped to market. The sturdy bottles used for Sparkling wine are designed to safely contain roughly 60 pounds of internal pressure from the carbon dioxide that gives the wine its effervescence when opened and poured. Two other methods are used to gain this effect at less time and labor cost. One is a labor-saving method in which the finished sparkling wine is transferred into new bottles and processed for shipment to market. The third method is the bulk process through which most semi-effervescent and sparkling wine is produced. Created in the 1850s, the process is identified as the Martinotti-Charmat method and the secondary fermentation takes place in controlled pressure tanks, then filtered, refrigerated and bottled under pressure. In this case the second fermentation takes place in a pressure tank before the wine is bottled. It is a method that can produce a more fruity tasting wine but does not hold its sparkle nearly as long as the other two methods. The most prestigious, and expensive, sparkling wines are made through the first process and will usually bear on their labels the note méthode champenoise, "méthode traditional" or in Italy the note método classico.


F
Spumante
Popular Italian sparkling wine.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. 
<b>A name used for Sparkling Wines produced in Italy.</b> By volume the most important regions for production of these are Asti, Cuneo and Alessandria, where the base wine is Moscato Bianco (or Moscato di Canelli).  Attractive sparkling wines labeled Gran Spumante are also being produced using the traditional Champagne grape varieties Pinot Noir and Chardonnay and a prestigious sparkler is produced under DOCG controls in the Franciacorta.

(aka Chenin Blanc): <b>Steen is South Africa's most common white grape and by one producer or another has been produced in every version possible.</b> The premium table wines made from this grape are now identified as and sold as Chenin Blanc, which serves as a clearer marketing identification for purposes of the export trade. 


r
Super-Tuscans
Rule-breaking Tuscan red wines.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>This term started with the introduction of two wines in the mid-seventies which had a tremendous and continuing impact on the wines of Tuscany.</b> The first was <b>Sassicaia</b>, which radically presented a wine that was essentially a Cabernet Sauvignon grown, fermented, packaged and offered for sale right in the heart of Chianti. The second was <b>Tignanello</b>, which substituted Cabernet Sauvignon for the 'Chianti-blend' requirement of the grape Canaiolo. Both of these wines served to break open the winemaking regulations that prevented winemakers from trying to improve the quality of Chianti. While regarded at the time as very threatening to their neighboring Chianti producers, the Sassicaia vineyards were transformed into Italy's only single-estate Italian appellation (DOC) and the two wines became great critical successes that were instrumental in breaking the deadlock around changing the the winemaking regulations of the region. It also allowed the change of very restrictive controls that had prevented winemakers from improving Chianti. 

y
SYLVANER
A spelling for Silvaner grape.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
(aka Silvaner): <b>The Sylvaner spelling for this grape became adopted in Alsace, whose wineries have been successful in producing it as a firmly bodied white wine to accompany Alsatian cuisine.</b> 


y
SYMPHONY
Delivers floral scented whites.
Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres. <br />(Dessert) Desserts, Cheese, Or Fresh Fruit.
<b>The Symphony grape delivers wines with floral, perfume-like scents and is used to produce moderately sweet, well-balanced, fruity table wines, as well as some appealing dessert wines.</b> A cross between Grenache Gris and Muscat Alexandria, it was developed by Dr. Harold Olmo, of the University of California at Davis. 


r
SYRAH
Exceptional Rhone grape variety.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka Shiraz). <b> Grape variety producing red wine with accessible aromas combined with an agreeable suppleness in the mouth.</b> Its appeal is enhanced by flavors that can linger long in the aftertaste. Known for producing outstanding wines in the northern Rhône region of France and very popular sturdy reds in Australia, California and South Africa, this variety has spread throughout New World wine-producing regions. Not quite as demanding of perfect viticultural site conditions as Cabernet Sauvignon, it can excel in slightly warmer climate conditions than Cabernet and deliver very appealing medium-bodied wines.


r
TANNAT
Most important wine of Uruguay.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>Intensely colored, tough and deep, wines from this red grape are often blended with other red varieties to help manage its tannins, yet Tannat wines can serve as an excellent match with grilled meats.</b> Found as a blended wine in the Madiran and Cahors appellations in southwest France, it is a take charge, dominating variety of winegrape even when blended with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and/or Pinenc. The variety may have originated in the Basque country of Spain but once it traveled west and reached Uruguay it became that country’s most important red variety. It is now spreading to many other New World vineyards, where it is surfacing in the wine market as a varietal, rather than simply as part of a blended wine.


r
Taurasi
Plum, chocolate tones & lengthy.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>The wines are deep in color, offer plum and chocolate tones and have a fairly lengthy finish.</b> This is the best known wine of the Campania region of southern Italy and is principally composed of the Aglianico grape. When grown in volcanic soils, at higher elevations and is allowed to be harvested at maturity, these are impressive wines and display the grape at its best expression.

Tavel
Outstanding Grenache rosés.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.<br /> (Aperitif) Sipping Wines To Serve With Hors D’Oeuvres.
<b>Grenache-Cinsaut based rosé wines are the famed product of this southern Rhône appellation.</b> The dry rosés from this region serve well as a warm weather refreshment. The wines have a delightful impression of sweetness due to its blend of the fragrant scents from Grenache and Cinsaut grapes, yet its limited presence of residual sugar is below most wine consumer’s threshold levels and the wine will present an attractive clean and lingering finish.


r
TEMPRANILLO
Distinguished Spanish red grape.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
(aka Tinta de Toro and Cencibel): <b>Many deeply colored, well-balanced and distinctive red wines are produced from this grape, which can favorably be compared with Cabernet Sauvignons as a source for distinguished, long-lived, age-worthy wines.</b> It is either the world's third or fourth most planted red grape variety. Its reputation was originally built through the red wines of the Rioja region of Spain and is currently at the heart of many of the other important red wines emerging from the various wine districts of Spain. For example it is largely responsible for the rising popularity of the 'Toro' and 'Ribera Del Duero' wines. Tempranillo is also produced as a varietal wine in various New World wine regions and the grape is generating renewed interest in both Australia and California as viticultural sites are sought that might produce wines of similar high quality to those of Spain. This grape is also used in the Douro Valley of Portugal as a major element in the production of Port.

<b>The common thread between three separate grapes bearing this name is a faint-to-forward Muscat-like fragrance.</b> Essentially all three can be found produced as dry, well-balanced, fresh tasting, medium-bodied white wine with an aftertaste reminiscent of almonds. The wines are at their best served chilled. As revealed by DNA profiling, similar crosses produced the three Torrontés and the wines produced were similar enough narrowing the identity just didn't make a difference from a consumers perspective. It is the major white varietal wine offered on the market by producers in Argentina but also reaches wine markets from Chile, the Canary Islands and Spain and seems to be gaining in popularity. Like other wines delivering Muscat aromas, it can reveal an edge of bitterness in the finish when made in a dry style.  


r
Toscana
Tuscan red Chianti alternative.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A major new category of wine and alternative to Chianti, this new Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is reaching international markets marketed as 'Toscana'.</b> This wine combines the fruit of Tuscany's dominant grape, Sangiovese, in blends picking up the fruit tones of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon as well as nuances of small barrel oak aging. So much change has gone on in this important wine producing region since the introduction of the Super-Tuscans, the producers could be grouped together with the New World Winemakers. There are also producers releasing blends of Syrah with Sangiovese.

TOURIGA FRANCA
Grape produces attractive reds.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc. <br />Light Meats, Pastas, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The perfumed quality of these red grapes makes this variety very attractive for both table wine producers and the Porto winemakers.</b> A relatively new red grape variety in the Douro Valley, it has performed so well on warm south facing slopes it has recently become a major grape of preference for Porto producers. Its aromatic qualities and fruit forward character as a wine should also gain it good presence on the international table wine market.


r
TOURIGA NACIONAL
Makes a robust red table wine.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>A grape variety that produces a deep hued, rather tannic and forceful red wine.</b> Touriga Nacional has long been held in high esteem for production of Porto but is now being enthusiastically offered as a robust table wine from both Portugal and Australia, it is also being tried by a wide range of New World winemakers and seems to be gaining a substantial toehold as an International table wine variety.

Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.<br />(Shellfish) Shrimp, Clams, Lobster, Oysters, Scallops, etc. 
<b>A very useful white grape and almost omnipresent ingredient in Italian white table wines.</b> The advantage is that its wines never assertively compete with or overwhelm the flavors of even the most subtle of the pasta, rice and seafood dishes with which it is usually served.  While the grape yields juice of limited complexity and hard-to-find distinction, it is usually produced as a light, crisp wine and it is useful as a blending wine for the same reasons. Its acidity can help the balance of whatever varieties it is blended. This grape under an array of names and clonal variations (not including Trebbiano di Soave or Trebbiano di Lugana, which are actually misidentifications of the grape variety Verdicchio) is arguably the fourth most planted white wine grape in the world.

<b>A white grape generally produced as an agreeable light, fresh tasting wine with fairly subtle but distinctive fruity aromas.</b> Well-balanced in the mouth and offering suggestions of lime, grapefruit and a touch of herbaceousness in its flavors, the wine has a fairly long finish and is capable of aging gracefully. The wine is primarily identified with the Rueda district of Spain.


y
VERDELHO
Australian full-bodied white.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc.
<b>The grape produces a full-bodied, quite firm white table wine.</b> In Madeira and the Azore Islands before the use of DNA testing became wide spread, the name was applied to several different grape varieties. It can still be expected to be an inconsistently used name, including a confusion with the Spanish Verdejo. Successfully grown in Australia's Hunter Valley since the nineteen hundreds, it has more recently made a successful jump to Western Australia.

VERDICCHIO
Fairly full-bodied white wines.
Chicken, Pork, Veal, Game Hen, Sweetbreads, Casseroles, etc. <br />(Seafood) Fish, Squid, Octopus, Eels, Rays, etc.
<b>This white grape, in its multiple clonal variations, produces fairly full-bodied table wines with a crisp, tangy balance.</b> It is one of the most prevalent white varieties of central Italy and along the Adriatic coast. Perhaps its most distinctive wines are produced in the Marche region of Italy, but it serves as an important ingredient in Verdicchio di Castelli Jesi and Verdicchio Matelica and has found its way into the Azores, Australia, Madeira as well as into some California vineyards.

ZINFANDEL
Reminiscent of sun ripened fruit.
Beef, Lamb, Venison, Wild Duck, Hearty Vegetable Stews, etc.
<b>The first taste of Zinfandel will always remind you that it was produced of sun ripened fruit.</b> While Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir fruit reach the winery's crusher in the form of small and evenly ripened clusters of fruit, California's aromatic red grape reaches the crusher as large, mixed clusters of berries that can range between unripened 'shot' berries to berries beginning to raisin from exposure to the sun. And while Cabernet may remind one of currants and Pinot noir of cherries, Zinfandel will be reminiscent of the tart-sweet qualities of raspberries. These grapes have been turned, by one winemaker or another, into practically every style of wine imaginable and the wines are beginning to reach markets in other parts of the world both as a finished and locally produced wine. In its most prestigious form it appears as a distinctive medium- to full-bodied red table wine with a forward fruitiness that serves exceptionally well with hearty, well-seasoned foods and tomato-based sauces. In this form it ages well and can gain appealing nuances and complexities over an 8 to 12 year period. Wines in the alcohol level range of 12-13.5% can be found as relatively light and fruity table wines while in the 14.5-16% alcohol range Zinfandel becomes a fairly powerful and hearty wine intended as a match for the most savory of foods. DNA profiling indicates that Zinfandel and Italy's Primitivo both originated on the Dalmatian Coast from an almost extinct Croatian variety named Crljenak Kastelanski. Vineyards have been planted in Western Australia, South Africa, India and even in the northern Rhone. Many of the best California Zinfandels are sourced from mountain vineyards in Sonoma County, the Santa Cruz Mountains and Sierra Nevada foothills appellations.
